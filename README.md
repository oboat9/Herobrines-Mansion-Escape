A project for our Grade 11 Computer Science class where we have to code an escape themed game in **Java**

## Overview

![main menu](core/assets/screenshots/lowresMainMenu.png)

### About the Game

This is a semi text-based game. The player interacts with the game using text, the game responds to the player using visuals and audio.

#### Instructions

Press SPACE to bring up the command window and then you can start typing your command

- *on some systems the command window will not be automatically selected so you might have to click on it. this should only happen the first time and it will usually be automatically selected on subsequent commands*

If you type a command that the game does not recognize you will hear an audible beep

When you type a recognizable command you will see the corrisponding action represented on the screen or via auditory feedback

### Command list

A basic command list for the game (extremely subject to change)

The commands after the dash is an alias and they work exactly the same as the main command but are just faster to type

- North - N
- South - S
- East - E
- West - W

- Use {Object Name}
- Look - L

## Requirements

### To Run

- [Java 1.8+](https://www.java.com/)
- For the latest "Stable" Build (For Mr. Wain) go to the [Releases](https://github.com/oboat9/Herobrines-Mansion-Escape/releases)
- Latest Unstable Build is located in /desktop/build/libs/

### To Contribute

The IDE setup is based [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/YCGmXVCvogY?list=PLrnO5Pu2zAHKAIjRtTLAXtZKMSA6JWnmf) (don't bother with the android SDK part) its best you follow this to set up your development environment properly

- [Java 1.8+](https://www.java.com/)
- Java Compatible IDE (Preferably [Eclipse IDE](eclipse.org/downloads/packages/installer)) (BlueJ isn't ideal for a project like this.)
- Gradle for Eclipse. just import the Gradle project into eclipse
