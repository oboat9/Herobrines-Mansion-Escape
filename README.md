A project for our Computer Science (Grade 11) class where we have to code an escape themed game in **Java**

## Requirements to Run Game
- [Java 1.8+](https://www.java.com/)

The IDE setup is based [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/YCGmXVCvogY?list=PLrnO5Pu2zAHKAIjRtTLAXtZKMSA6JWnmf) (dont bother with the android SDK part) its best you follow this to setup your development environment properly

- [Java 1.8+](https://www.java.com/)
- Java Compatible IDE (Preferably [Eclipse IDE](eclipse.org/downloads/packages/installer)) (BlueJ isn't ideal for a project like this.)
- [LibGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/download.html) (Think of it like PyGame for java)
