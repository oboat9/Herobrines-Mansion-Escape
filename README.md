# Herobrines-Mansion-Escape
A project for our Computer Science (Grade 11) class where we have to code an escape themed game in **Java**

## Instructions
This is a semi text-based game. All the player interaction is done via text commands but there is a visual and audio representation of the world as well.

### Command list
##### Movement
 - North, N
 - South, S
 - East, E
 - West, W

##### Interactions
 - Use {Object Name} (use an object)
 - Look, L (observe the area)(WIP) 

## Requirements to Run Game
- [Java 1.8+](https://www.java.com/)
- Jar is located in /desktop/build/libs/

### Requirements to Contribute to Project
The IDE setup is based [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/YCGmXVCvogY?list=PLrnO5Pu2zAHKAIjRtTLAXtZKMSA6JWnmf) (don't bother with the android SDK part) its best you follow this to set up your development environment properly

- [Java 1.8+](https://www.java.com/)
- Java Compatible IDE (Preferably [Eclipse IDE](eclipse.org/downloads/packages/installer)) (BlueJ isn't ideal for a project like this.)
- [LibGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/download.html) (Think of it like PyGame for java)
- Gradle (Eclipse plugin)
