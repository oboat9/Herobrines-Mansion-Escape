### About the Game

This is a semi text-based game. The player interacts with the game using text, the game responds to the player using visuals and audio.

#### Instructions

Press SPACE to bring up the command window and then you can start typing your command

- *on some systems the command window will not be automatically selected so you might have to click on it. this should only happen the first time and it will usually be automatically selected on subsequent commands*

If you type a command that the game does not recognize you will hear an audible beep

When you type a recognizable command you will see the corrisponding action represented on the screen or via auditory feedback

### Command list

A basic command list for the game

The commands after the dash is an alias and they work exactly the same as the main command but are just faster to type.
Commands are not case sensitive!

- North - N
- South - S
- East - E
- West - W

- Use {Object Name}
- Look - L (use this frequently)
- THERE ARE SOME COMMANDS THAT ARE NOT IN THIS LIST YOU WILL HAVE TO PLAY TO FIND THEM
